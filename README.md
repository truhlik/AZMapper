# AZMapper

AZMapper is a simple mapper for the Microsoft .NET platform. It provides an easy way for mapping a result 
from a traditional relational database to the required entity.

The intention is not to replace any existing ORM mapper like NHibernat or EntityFramwork but simplify all that staff 
with the database in place where all these traditionals ORMs cannot be used or high performance is required.
